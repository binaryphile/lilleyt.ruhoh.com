I noticed that the portable key layout mapping for Minimak-to-QWERTY had
the "M" position typing "R".

I've posted a new revision to github, which you can [download here].  I
posted it around 5pm today.

Sorry for the inconvenience, and if you find any problems with the
layouts, submit [an issue] on github.
